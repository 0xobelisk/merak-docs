In the `Source Token` dropdown, select the token you want to wrap (e.g., SUI). Your available SUI balance will be shown next to the input field.

### 4. Enter Wrap Amount

In the `Amount` field, enter the amount of SUI you wish to wrap. You can also click `Max` to use your full available balance.

### 5. Confirm and Wrap

After entering the amount, click the `Wrap` button. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Approve the transaction to complete the wrapping process.
